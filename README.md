##  Survival Outcome Prediction for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Using Machine Learning Ensemble Model

###  Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **Event-Free Survival (EFS)** outcomes for patients undergoing **Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT)** using a **machine learning ensemble approach**.
The system integrates **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, and **XGBoost** models using a **soft voting ensemble**, improving accuracy and robustness.
To make the model interpretable for clinicians, **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)** is incorporated to visualize how each clinical feature influences the prediction.

---

###  Objective

* To predict patient survival outcomes after HCT based on clinical and donor-related data.
* To improve accuracy and stability using an ensemble of multiple ML models.
* To enhance interpretability through SHAP-based feature explanation.
* To provide a user interface where clinicians can upload patient data and obtain survival predictions.

---

###  Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values using imputation.
   * One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
   * Feature normalization for uniform scaling.

2. **Model Training**

   * Individual models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost.
   * Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
   * Ensemble through **soft voting** to combine prediction probabilities.

3. **Explainability**

   * **SHAP** was used to identify and visualize top influencing features.
   * Enhances model transparency for clinical decision-making.

---

###  Dataset

* Source: Public dataset from **Kaggle** (HCT clinical dataset)
* **Total records:** 28,800
* **Features:** 60 (Demographic, Clinical, Donor-related, and Disease-related)
* **Target variable:** `efs` (Event-Free Survival)

---

###  Technologies Used

### Results Visualization

* SHAP Summary plots highlight top influencing features such as:

  * `age_at_hct`
  * `dri_score`
  * `comorbidity_score`
  * `hla_match_c_high`

These help clinicians understand **why** a certain prediction was made.
